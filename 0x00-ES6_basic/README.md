# ES6 Basics

This project explores the fundamental concepts of ECMAScript 6 (ES6). We work with features such as block-scoped variables, arrow functions, rest and spread syntax, and more, which allow us to write cleaner and more efficient JavaScript code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain what ES6 is and its significance.
- Identify new features introduced in ES6.
- Differentiate between constants and variables.
- Use block-scoped variables (`let`, `const`).
- Write concise and flexible functions using arrow functions.
- Utilize default parameters in functions.
- Apply rest and spread syntax for function arguments and arrays.
- Use string templating for cleaner string formatting.
- Create objects with shorthand property names.
- Understand and work with iterators and for-of loops.

## Requirements

- All files will be executed on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS** using **NodeJS 12.11.x**.
- Code editor: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, or **Visual Studio Code**.
- All files should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory.
- Code will be tested using **Jest** and analyzed using **ESLint**.
- All functions must be exported.
