## Project Overview
This project is focused on understanding and working with ES6 Promises in JavaScript. The goal is to deepen your knowledge of asynchronous operations and how to handle them using Promises, `then`, `catch`, `async`, and `await` syntax. 

**Project Start:** Oct 1, 2024, 6:00 AM  
**Project Deadline:** Oct 3, 2024, 6:00 AM  
**Checker Release:** Oct 1, 2024, 6:00 PM  
An auto review will be launched at the deadline.
